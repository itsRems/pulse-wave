## Requirements
Wave requires NodeJS v12+ and a redis instance to connect to. It also requires a storage driver (if you plan on using collections - WHICH DO NOT WORK AT THE TIME OF WRITING THESE DOCS).
The default redis instance wave will try to connect to is 127.0.0.1:6379, but you can change this using `config`.
